A mixed-use protected area, the Okapi Reserve protects 13,726 sq km (5125 sq mi), an area larger than Death Valley National Park, or slightly smaller than the state of Connecticut or the country of Montenegro. The reserve protects the rights of access to arable land for indigenous Bantu horticulturalist communities as well. <p>In 1996, Okapi Wildlife Reserve was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site, by virtue of it containing the most important and significant natural habitats for in-situ biodiversity conservation of threatened species. The reserve harbors globally important populations of African forest elephant, okapi, and eastern chimpanzees, as well as 13 other species of diurnal primate and four nocturnal species, ranking it as the top protected area in sub-Saharan Africa in terms of primate diversity.",

The reserve's history has been marred by spates of militarized elephant poaching, mining, and episodes of contact between park guards and militia groups, and the communities within the reserve remain very poor. Land and resource use within the reserve limit human migration and are meant to support only smallholder farming and sustainable, discriminate hunting. Despite these policies and strong management, the conservation outlook for the reserve remains critical as it has been retained on the List of World Heritage in Danger by UNESCO since 1997.",

Small-scale artisanal mining has represented a persistent challenge in managing the reserve's southwest bloc throughout the 2010s. On a few occasions, park guards cleared thousands of miners out from these mines located deep inside the forest. The DRCâ€™s Mining Cadastre uses a version of the Reserveâ€™s boundaries which are roughly 2/3 of the actual size, with the western boundary moved eastwards by over 22 kilometers (14 miles), and the northern boundary moved southwards by over 25 kilometers (16 miles), and the southern boundary moved northwards by over 12 kilometers (8 miles).<p><i><t> Mining concession data are hosted on the <a href='http://drclicences.cami.cd/EN/'>DRC Mining Cadastre Map Portal</a>. While the Mining Cadastre has shared its concession data with multiple sources in the past, the protected area boundaries data that they use are not downloadable. The CAMI representation of the Okapi Reserve boundary was therefore digitized and looks blocky, because the Mining Cadastre conforms concessions to a 30-arc second grid.<p>The Okapi Reserve has a total area of 13,726.25 sq km according to the <a href='https://www.protectedplanet.net/37043/'> World Database on Protected Areas</a>, while CAMI's representation of the boundaries covers only 9107 sq km, a reduction of 33% of its area.</i>",

Due to its unregulated, illicit nature, artisanal mining leads to environmental damage, including deforestation and water pollution. Furthermore, in the Reserveâ€™s delicate context, control of mining areas exacerbated conflict between different groups. Artisanal mining also impacts wildlife populations because miners tend to eat available bushmeat, which disincentivizes sustainable hunting in the Reserve. On a few occasions, park management cleared artisanal mines located deep inside the forest, as well as semi-industrial actors encroaching on the Reserve by dredging the Ituri River.",
