The reserve protects the rights of access to arable land for indigenous Bantu horticulturalist communities as well. <p>In 1996, Okapi Wildlife Reserve was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site, by virtue of it containing the most important and significant natural habitats for in-situ biodiversity conservation of threatened species. The reserve harbors globally important populations of African forest elephant, okapi, and eastern chimpanzees, as well as 13 other species of diurnal primate and four nocturnal species, ranking it as the top protected area in sub-Saharan Africa in terms of primate diversity.",

Land and resource use within the reserve limit human migration and are meant to support only smallholder farming and sustainable, discriminate hunting. Despite these policies and decent management, the conservation outlook for the reserve remains critical as it has been retained on the List of World Heritage in Danger by UNESCO since 1997.",

            description: "Small-scale artisanal mining represented a persistent challenge in managing the Reserveâ€™s southern bloc throughout the 2010s, Due to its unregulated, illicit nature, artisanal mining leads to environmental damage, including deforestation and water pollution. Furthermore, in the Reserveâ€™s delicate context, control of mining areas exacerbated conflict between different groups. Artisanal mining also impacts wildlife populations because miners tend to eat available bushmeat, which disincentivizes sustainable hunting in the Reserve. On a few occasions, park management cleared artisanal mines located deep inside the forest, as well as semi-industrial actors encroaching on the Reserve by dredging the Ituri River.",
